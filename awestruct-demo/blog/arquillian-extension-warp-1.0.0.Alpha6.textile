This release fixes some regressions found in Alpha5.

h3. WildFly Support

We had some problems with enriching the inspections with WildFly.

We've switched our integration tests to run with WildFly 8.0.0.CR1 by default.

h3. Filtering Requests by GET/POST Parameter

As you "may notice":https://community.jboss.org/thread/234234, Warp didn't support filtering the requests. Moreover @Alpha5@ didn't even have a way to get the relevant information from the @HttpRequest@ interface. This is now fixed with @Alpha6@ and you can start using this new API:

bc(prettify).. Warp
   .activity(Activity)
   .observe(request().parameter().equal("id", "12345"))
   .inspect(Inspection);

p. You can find a better "example in the functional test suite":https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-extension-warp/blob/master/ftest/src/test/java/org/jboss/arquillian/warp/ftest/observer/TestHttpParameterFiltering.java#L79.

h3. Upgrade to LittleProxy 1.0.0-beta-5 and Netty 4

Warp internally uses LittleProxy (that uses Netty) for request interception and enrichment.

Even though this shouldn't affect you negatively, there might be some regressions.

But on a positive note, we are no longer seeing some intermittent issues (the test got occasionally stuck) after upgraded from LittleProxy 0.5.3.
