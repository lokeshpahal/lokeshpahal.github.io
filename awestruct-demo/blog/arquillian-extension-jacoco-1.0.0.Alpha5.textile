h3(highlights). Some of the highlights in this release

<i class="icon-star"></i> EclEmma Eclipse Plugin support

When you run your Arquillian tests via "Coverage As -> JUnit" in Eclipse, you'll now see the remote coverage data collected by the Arquillian Jacoco Extension right there alongside the client coverage data. In your IDE!

It's no longer needed to go via Maven and view the html output. Maven is of course still supported.

<i class="icon-star"></i> We added Include/Exclude filtering

The default filer is *.class. But you might not want to record coverage data on all the external libraries in your deployment. By using Include and Exclude filters you can control what is recorded. 

bc(prettify).. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<arquillian
  xmlns="http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="
        http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian
        http://jboss.org/schema/arquillian/arquillian_1_0.xsd">

  <extension qualifier="jacoco">
    <property name="excludes">my.package.some.*</property>
    <property name="includes">my.package.some.include.*,my.package.some.other.*</property>
  </extension>
        
</arquillian>
