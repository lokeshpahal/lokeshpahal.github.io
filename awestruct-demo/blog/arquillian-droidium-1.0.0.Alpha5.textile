Arquillian Droidium 1.0.0.Alpha5 is packed with bugfixes, updates and it has integrated with various other Arquillian extensions.

h3. Extension integration

Droidium now profits from the Arquillian Spacelift extension that provide a robust way of dealing with execution of external binaries and applications. In Droidium, we use it to handle the execution of all Android-related binaries.

We also have created a Arquillian Droidium Screenshooter extension which builds on top of the Arquillian Reporter extension. If you have Arquillian Reporter extension on class path, you can generate reports for your (mobile) test runs very easily and export them in a lot of different formats like XML, JSON, HTML or even Asciidoctor.

p(info). %It is recommended to use Selendroid server of version 0.9.0 and Android SDK 22.6.2.%

h3. Next stop, Beta

Arquillian Droidium 1.0.0.Alpha5 is the last Alpha release before reaching Beta stage. Starting with Beta1, you can expect experimental support for Arquillian Drone 2.0.0.Alpha1, removal of web plugin which depends on the deprecated Selenium Android server APK, that will be replaced by the Selendroid's Android driver. It will also be updated to use Selenium 2.40 from current 2.39.
