h3. Some of the Highlights in This Release

Drone 1.1.0.CR2 is a bugfix release form the previous 1.1.0 CR release. We fixed browserCapability usage, reusing browers sessions and Selenium Server user extensions support.

h3. Big thanks to the community

I'd like to thank Arquillian Drone Community, especially Ste Gr and Simon SÃ¸ndergaard for helping us test and patch the release by proactively using new features. 
It's a pleasure to work with you guys!
