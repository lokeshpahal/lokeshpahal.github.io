p. We just released a new version of the Transaction Extension that has two important improvements:

p. First of all we noticed some unexpected behaviour when using the extension with embedded containers. To make a long story short - transactions where not handled correctly in some cases. 

p. In addition we changed the way the configuration is loaded. It is now handled at a more appropriate time - when the descriptors are loaded (not before the test suite, as it was before). Many thanks to "PÃ«tr Andreev":https://github.com/petrandreev for spotting the latter and sending a pull request!
