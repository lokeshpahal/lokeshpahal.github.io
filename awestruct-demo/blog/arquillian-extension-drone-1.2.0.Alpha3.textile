!(graphic pull-right)/images/blog/drone_400.png! This release brings you PhantomJS binary auto resolution and a major update of SPI's for extension creators.

<br/>

h3(highlights). Significant changes since 1.2.0.Alpha2

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Support for PhantomJS binary auto resolution :=
The PhantomJS binary is now automatically resolved if it's not found using the @phantomjs.binary.path@ property. So you don't have to specify this property anymore.

div(filename). arquillian.xml

bc(prettify).. <extension qualifier="webdriver">
    <property name="browserCapabilities">phantomjs</property>
</extension> 
=:

- <i class="icon-star"></i> New SPI Model :=
If you are writing your own Arquillian extension and you would like to use Arquillian Drone, it is now much simpler. Drone exposes events for browser configuration, creation, enrichement, enhancement and disposal, giving you full control of its lifecycle. If you have used the old SPI model, there are now other interfaces you might need to implement. 
=:

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Updated to WebDriver 2.33.0 :=
Arquillian Drone uses WebDriver 2.33.0 by default. You can still use @selenium-bom@ to override the WebDriver versions if needed. 
=:

Drone is now based on top of Arquillian Core 1.1.1.Final. Please update your @<dependencyManagement>@ sections if you're using Arquillian BOM (artifactId: @arquillian-bom@) together with Arquillian Drone BOM.

I'd like to thank everybody involved in this release. _You guys make testing a breeze!_
 
We hope that you'll enjoy the improvements and look forward to hear your feedback in the "community forums":#{site.project_space}.
