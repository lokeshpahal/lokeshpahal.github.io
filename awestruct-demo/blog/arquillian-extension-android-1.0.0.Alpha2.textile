Arquillian Android Extension has reached the Alpha2 milestone. This is a bugfix release with a few new nice features.

h3(highlights). Significant changes in 1.0.0.Alpha2 

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Ability to specify ABI :=
Since Android 4 the SDK allows to define multiple ABI types for the emulator. We now honor this property and fail fast if multiple ABIs are available during creation of the emulator.
