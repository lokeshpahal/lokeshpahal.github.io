This release brings you better Firefox support and configurable browser instantiation timeout.

<br/>

h3. What's new in Drone 1.2.0.Beta1?

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Browser capabilities shorthand :=
Since the @browserCapabilities@ property was made the default way to set the type of WebDriver you wanted, people have been asking for a simpler name. Now you can just use the @browser@ property instead. While the original property is marked deprecated, we won't be removing it in the 1.x series.

div(filename). arquillian.xml

bc(prettify).. <extension qualifier="webdriver">
    <!-- since now, you can simply write "browser" -->
    <property name="browser">chrome</property>
</extension> 
=:

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Global Drone configuration in arquillian.xml :=
Since 1.2.0.Alpha3, Selenium and WebDriver instances are retrieved using a time limit, avoiding your tests to get stuck. This limit is now 60 seconds by default and can be modified in _arquillian.xml_ file globally for all supported Drones. Also, the limit is disabled if you set @arquillian.debug@ property to @true@.

div(filename). arquillian.xml

bc(prettify).. <extension qualifier="drone">
    <!-- set this to zero if you want to disable timeout -->
    <property name="instantiationTimeoutInSeconds">0</property>
</extension> 
=:

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Firefox goodies :=
WebDriver configuration now accepts two new configuration properties, @firefox_profile@ and @firefoxUserPreferences@. While the first one is not really new, it allows you to set a path to the Firefox profile template, the latter makes it possible to modify _prefs.js_ for the created Firefox profile.

div(filename). arquillian.xml

bc(prettify).. <extension qualifier="webdriver">
    <property name="firefox_profile">/path/to/profile</property>
    <property name="firefoxUserPreferences">/path/to/preferences/file</property>
</extension> 
=:

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Updated to WebDriver 2.35.0 :=
Arquillian Drone uses Selenium 2.35.0 by default. Due to recent WebDriver API changes(>=2.34.0), we do not recommend the use of the _selenium-bom_ in @<dependencyManagement>@ to downgrade to a older Selenium version. For the very same reason, we recommend you to update "Arquillian Graphene to 2.0.0.Alpha5":/blog/2013/09/04/arquillian-graphene-2-0-0-Alpha5/ that is compatible with latest Selenium. Also note that Selenium 2.35.0 deprecated the @IPhoneDriver@, so Drone did the same.
=:

Drone is based on top of Arquillian Core 1.1.0.Final. Please update your @<dependencyManagement>@ sections if you're using Arquillian BOM (artifactId: @arquillian-bom@) together with Arquillian Drone BOM.

I'd like to thank everybody involved in this release. _You guys make testing a breeze!_
 
We hope that you'll enjoy the improvements and look forward to hear your feedback in the "community forums":#{site.project_space}.
