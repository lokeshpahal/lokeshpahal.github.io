bq. "Thatâ€™s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."

When you look at list of changes in this release it might not appear as the biggest release in the history of Arquillian Universe, but it's definitely important one for Spock and Arquillian fans. Big kudos this time go to "Karel Piwko":profile://kpiwko and Fabian Schwarzer. Karel gave us a choice between Groovy 1.8 and 2.x and Fabian spotted shortcomings of previous integration approach implemented as global Spock extension. By having those two improvements in place we are getting very close to the final stable release!

h3(highlights). Important changes

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Annotation driven activation := In order to let Arquillian sneak in to the Spock dimension you'll need to annotate your @Specification@ using @@ArquillianSpecification@. 

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Groovy 1.8 and 2.0 := We also updated the Spock and Groovy versions. We guarantee that the following combinations won't let you down:
* For Groovy 2.x, use spock 0.7-groovy-2.0 or later and Groovy 2.1.4 or later
* For Groovy 1.x, use spock 0.7-groovy-1.8 or later and Groovy 1.8.9 or later 

p. You can always take a look at our "examples":https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-testrunner-spock/tree/master/examples where we show how to use both versions with Maven.

p. Both "Spock":http://code.google.com/p/spock/ and Arquillian let you test your code with pleasure so wait no more and give it a spin!
