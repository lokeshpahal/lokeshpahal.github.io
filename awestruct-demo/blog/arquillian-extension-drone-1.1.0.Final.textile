!(graphic pull-right)/images/blog/drone_400.png! We've introduced new features in 1.1.0.Final while still preserving backwards compatibility with 1.0.0.Final. There's now a much simpler way to configure Drone, better support for the Opera browser and support for browsers on iOS devices.

h3(highlights). Significant changes since 1.0.0.Final

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Browser capabilities instead of @implementationClass@ and native capability configuration :=
Think of any WebDriver capability, such as @opera.no_restart@ or @acceptSSLCerts@, and you can now specify it directly in @arquillian.xml@:

div(filename). arquillian.xml

bc(prettify).. <extension qualifier="webdriver">
    <property name="browserCapabilities">opera</property>
    <property name="opera.no_restart">true</property>
    <property name="acceptSSLCerts">false</property>
</extension> =:
- <i class="icon-star"></i> Support for reusable browsers :=
Reusable browsers stay connected even if you finish the tests. This will speed up turnaroud when developing the application. Reusable browsers are based on top of remote browsers, so you'll need Selenium Hub (run *selenium-server-standalone-2.25.0.jar*) running during your tests. This is how you enable them (@remoteAddress@ is optional, default value listed here):

div(filename). arquillian.xml

bc(prettify).. <extension qualifier="webdriver">
    <property name="browserCapabilities">chrome</property>
    <property name="remoteReusable">true</property>
    <property name="remoteAddress">http://localhost:4444/wd/hub</property>
</extension> =:
- <i class="icon-star"></i> Better support for the Opera browser
- <i class="icon-star"></i> Support for browsers on iOS devices
- <i class="icon-star"></i> Deprecated Arquillian Drone system properties configuration :=
The system properties configuration provided by Arquillian Core is now the preferred way to configure Arquillian Drone. The old style of system properties still work, but using them will produce warnings in the log and will be removed completely in a future version. Now use @arq.extension.extensionName.propertyName@ to override a value from arquillian.xml file =:

I'd like to thank everybody from the community eagerly adopting new releases, discovering bugs and providing bugfixes. _You guys are awesome!_
