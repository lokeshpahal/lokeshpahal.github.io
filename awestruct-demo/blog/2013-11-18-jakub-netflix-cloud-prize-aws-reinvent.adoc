We'd like to congratulate https://github.com/jmnarloch[Jakub Narloch], a key Arquillian contributor and community member, on receiving a https://github.com/Netflix/Cloud-Prize/wiki[Netflix Open Source Software (OSS) cloud prize].
Jakub won the award for *_Best Contribution to Code Quality_* for his work integrating Arquillian into the Karyon and Genie projects.

Adrian Cockcroft, the Chief Cloud Architect at Netflix, announced the NetflixOSS cloud prize winners during a keynote session at the http://reinvent.awsevents.com[AWS re:Invent conference].

[quote,Adrian Cockcroft,Netflix keynote at AWS re:Invent]
____
When you are working on these projects, you have to worry about doing QA.
We wanted to have an enterprise entry for quality contributions.

Rather than just worrying about fixing bugs in one project, what Jakub [Narloch] did was integrate the JBoss Arquillian test framework that we develop everything from.

Now, all the projects we build going forward are going to have Arquillian built in.

Jakub and the other winners were present at AWS re:Invent to receive their award, a custom-made Cloud Monkey trophy, $10,000 in prize money from Netflix, $5,000 in AWS credits from Amazon and the cost of the trip to Las Vegas and admission to the conference.

Jakub started out by helping to configure Arquillian to do tests for the Denominator DNS integration with UltraDNS.
This work extended to include Karyon, the base server that underpins NetflixOSS services and the starting point for developing new services.
Netflix was able to leverage the same integration to test Genie, which is based on Karyon.

As Adrian mentioned in the keynote, all of the projects his team at Netflix builds will be tested with Arquillian on day one.

We appreciate all that Jakub has done for the Arquillian project and code quality.
Jakub entered into the Arquillian community as a Google Summer of Code student in 2012.
He successfully, and rapidly, completed his project to create a Spring Framework integration for Arquillian.
He now leads the Spring integration module, as well as the Guice integration and REST extension modules.
We are privileged to have Jakub as member of the Arquillian community.
Seriously.

We'd also like to thank Adrian Cockford, the http://netflix.github.io/#repo[NetflixOSS] group and the contest mentors for running the cloud prize contest and giving the Arquillian project and community an opportunity to prove its value.
We recognize Netflix as a valuable citizen and supporter of Arquillian and the broader open source community.
We certainly hope Arquillian helps to ensure the quality of your software and drives development forward for many years to come.

Finally, we'd like to thank https://twitter.com/adrianfcole[Adrian Cole], formerly at Netflix, for planting the Arquillian seed in the NetflixOSS group and for reaching out to the Arquillian community members to participate in the cloud prize contest.
Jakub rose to that challenge.
One of the primary projects Adrian worked on while at Netflix, Denominator--a multi-vender interface for DNS--was also represented in this cloud prize contest.
Adrian is a true hero of OSS, cloud platforms and Arquillian.

Thanks to Jakub, Adrian and Netflix, Ike invaded the big stage at AWS re:Invent!
