h3(highlights). What's included in the Alpha2 release?

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Configurable Polling sleep time := 
You can now configure the timeout for Cube to wait for a Docker container to start when using the polling await strategy using the following configuration:

bc(prettify).. await:
  strategy: polling
  sleepPollingTime: 200 s
  iterations: 3

p. See the "documentation":https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-cube#await for more information

- <i class="icon-star"></i> New port binding configuration parameters :=

In Alpha1 we used the following portBinding syntax:

bc(prettify).. portBindings:
  - exposedPort: 8089/tcp
    port: 8089
  - exposedPort: 8080/tcp
    port: 8080


p. We felt this was a bit verbose, so in Alpha2 we updated the syntax to:

bc(prettify).. portBindings:Â [8089->8089/tcp, 8080->8080/tcp]
