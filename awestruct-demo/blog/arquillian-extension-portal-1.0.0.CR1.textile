There are several important fixes in this release for those testing portlets with Arquillian.

h3. Some of the highlights in this release

<i class="icon-star"></i> Fix exceptions where there are multiple portlet deployments present on a Test class.

<i class="icon-star"></i> Allow @@PortalURL@ to be present on a test method parameter, in addition to a field.

<i class="icon-star"></i> Modify the parsing of portlet.xml to occur for each test instead of once per Test class.

We look forward to hearing your feedback about this release in the "community forums":#{site.project_space}!
