h3. New ways to use Drone

Drone 2.0.0.Alpha1 is the first release of the Drone overhaul. We are aiming to provide you better support for:

* extending Drone with new browser life cycles, such as one browser per _test suite_
* smoother and easier integration with existing and future extensions
* support for Drones bounded to deployments
* and much more

h3. Removing legacy and obsolete code from Drone

Since the Drone project started more than 3 years ago, some of the configuration options has changed and some of the features are now available as part of Arquillian Core.
The following code will be removed from Drone 2.x during the Alpha releases:

* removing support for system properties (now directly available from Arquillian Core)
* using capability based configuration (removing deprecated properties)
* removing support for Selenium 1 and Graphene 1 (following Selenium project)
* changing Drone events to support command pattern and to rely on _Drone context_
* removing @@Deprecated@ code

h3. What Drone version should I use?

If you want a stable version, go with 1.3.0.Final. If you need to run tests on mobile devices, keep using 1.2.4.Final. We'll be releasing Droidium based on the Drone 2.x stream soon to close the gap. However, if you like living on the edge, try Drone 2.0.0.Alpha1 and let us know how it works for you.

I'd like to thank Tadeáš Kříž. He's our hero for this release, as he implemented most of the overhaul!

We hope that you'll enjoy our new stuff and look forward to hear your feedback in the "community forums":#{site.project_space}.
