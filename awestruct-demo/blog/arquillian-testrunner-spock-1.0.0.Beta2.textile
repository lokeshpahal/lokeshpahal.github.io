bq. "In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."

Arquillian Spock Testrunner is back with the new version and bring important improvements in the area of specification execution. Yet again "Karel Piwko":profile://kpiwko evolves the Spock integration towards a Final release. He is the keeper of the state and you can rest assure he won't let the two universes collide!

h3(highlights). Important changes

- <i class="icon-star"></i> Annotation driven activation is now **obsolote** := @@ArquillianSpecification@ revealed itself to be more problematic than valuable (see JIRA issues below for details). Therefore we made a breaking change and got rid of it in favour for a custom test runner integrating both Spock and the Arquillian lifecycles. From now on you should simply decorate your specification with @@RunWith(ArquillianSputnik)@.


p. Both "Spock":http://code.google.com/p/spock/ and Arquillian let you test your code with pleasure, so wait no more and give it a spin!
