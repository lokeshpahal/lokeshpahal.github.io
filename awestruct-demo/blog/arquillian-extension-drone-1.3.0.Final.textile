h3. Removal of mobile related capabilities

In Arquillian Drone 1.3.0.Final we've upgraded to use Selenium 2.40.0. While the new version of Selenium brings you support for the latest browsers, it also dropped support for the *android* and *iphone* drivers. This change also effect Graphene, so make sure that you use Graphene 2.0.2.Final together with Drone 1.3.0.Final.

The *android* gap left by Selenium will be closed in a future release of Arquillian Drodium, where we will add test support for all native, hybrid and mobile web applications. Closing the *iphone* gap will unfortunately take us a little bit longer.

If you need to test on mobile devices, please keep using Arquillian Drone 1.2.4.Final. If you want the latest and greatest stuff for desktop browsers, go for Drone 1.3.0.Final.

We hope that you'll enjoy our new stuff and look forward to hear your feedback in the "community forums":#{site.project_space}.
