h3. Some of the highlights in this release

* Support for *Oracle WebLogic Server 12c (12.1.1)*.
  With the release, one can now test Java EE 6 applications in a WebLogic 12c container.

* Support for custom hostname verifiers.
  If your WebLogic Container is requires you to use a custom hostname verifier to accept it's SSL certificate, then it is now possible to configure Arquillian to use the hostname verifier.
  If you want to configure a hostname verifier, use the @hostnameVerifierClass@ and @classPath@ properties.

* Improvements in performance. Archives are now deployed faster to a WebLogic container.
