h3. Some of the highlights in this release

p. Support for nice multiline/pretty formatting of JVM-argument configuration. Additionally, you can use quotes to provide values containing spaces.

bc(prettify).. <property name="javaVmArguments">
  -Xms512m -Xmx512m
  -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
  "-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/path/to your/keystore"
</property>

p. Embedded Tomcat 7 is now capable of protected WAR deployment (this is usual in typical standalone server), thus some standard deployment features are now available even for embedded use, e.g.:
  * Deployment of an archive named "ROOT.war" to the default context "/"
  * Proper processing of "META-INF/context.xml" if present in the WAR.
