If you think doing integration testing is significantly slower, complex or just plain harder than unit testing, think again. In this video, "Aslak":profile://aslak shows how quickly you can go from an empty directory (0mph) to a project that runs a CDI test inside a managed "JBoss AS 7":http://jboss.org/as7 container (60mph) in under a minute using the "Arquillian plugin":http://github.com/forge/plugin-arquillian for "JBoss Forge":http://jboss.org/forge.

Notice that the test cold boots JBoss AS 7, deploys the tests and runs it in-container, then undeploys and shuts down the server in < 5 seconds. (It runs even faster when you take away the Maven cycle).

A quote by "Brian Leathem":profile://bleathem is suitable for quoting here:

bq. With tools like Arquillian, Shrinkwrap, [and] in-memory databases, [we] are busting through the old barriers of terms like unit and integration tests. Perhaps we need a new term for them: "real tests" or "useful tests" are two possibilities that come to mind.

Don't mock. Test for real.
