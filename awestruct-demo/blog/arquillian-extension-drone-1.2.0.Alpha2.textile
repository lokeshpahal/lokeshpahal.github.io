- <i class="icon-star"></i> Discarding cookies for reusable browsers :=
You can now use reusable browser while ensuring cooking from previous test runs do not affect current test run. The default behavior is to delete the cookies. If you want to preserve previous behavior, you can use the @reuseCookies@ configuration option.

This release breaks implementation compatibility with previous Drone releases. You should not be affected by this unless you use Drone combined with other projects that depend on more then just SPI, such as Graphene 2. We are releasing new compatible versions of these projects; such as Graphene 2.0.0.Alpha4.
These changes were done in order to make Drone more reusable by third party projects to avoid similar problems in future.

I'd like to thank everybody involved in this release. _You guys make testing a breeze!_
 
We hope that you'll enjoy the improvements and look forward to hear your feedback in the "community forums":#{site.project_space}.
