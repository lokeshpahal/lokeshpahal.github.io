    Bartosz Majsak ("@majson":http://twitter.com) is a software developer and consultant at Cambridge Technology Partners, based in Zurich, Switzerland, passionate about open source software and testing methodologies. By night, he's an open source junkie, often found hacking on Arquillian and ShrinkWrap.
    
    Bartosz became an Arquillian advocate early on, publishing multiple articles about Arquillian and how to extend it on his company's blog. It wasn't long before Bartosz became a key contributor to the Arquillian project. His unique interest in testing brings an endless source of new ideas and integrations to the project.
    
    His most notable contributions are "Arquillian Persistence":/modules/persistence-extension, an extension that makes writing database-oriented tests a breeze, and a "Spock Test Runner":/modules/spock-test-runner, which enables developers to write BDD-style Arquillian tests in Groovy. Bartosz leads both modules. He's also a frequent speaker at conferences around Europe on Arquillian-related topics.
    
    In 2012, Bartosz received a "JBoss Community Recognition Award":http://jboss.org/jbcra for his contribution of new features to Arquillian. One thing we love in the Arquillian community, test-infected developers like Bartosz!

    Hantsy seized the opportunity to contribute to Arquillian by translating many of the guides into Simplified Chinese, including "Getting Started":/guides/getting_started_zh_cn, "Getting Started: Rinse and Repeat":/guides/getting_started_rinse_and_repeat_zh_cn, "Getting Started Faster with Forge":/guides/get_started_faster_with_forge_zh_cn and "Testing Java Persistence":/guides/testing_java_persistence_zh_cn.
    
    In 2012, Hantsy received a "JBoss Community Recognition Award":http://jboss.org/jbcra for his formidable contribution of translations, more than any other individual. His contributions have opened up Arquillian to a whole new world of developers. In addition, his dedication has fueled the translation effort. There are now over two dozen translations of the Arquillian guides distributed across ten languages.

    Jakub Narloch ("@jmnarloch":http://twitter.com/jmnarloch) is a Java and .NET software developer who has successfully completed two Google Summer of Code projects and is defending a computer science thesis at the Warsaw University of Technology.
    
    In 2012, the inaugural year for the JBoss Community as a mentor organization in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program, Jakub put forth the most compelling proposal of all the candidates. "Jakub's proposal":http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2012/jnarloch/22002 would extend the boundaries of Arquillian by adding support for testing Spring applications. He not only achieved his goal, but far exceeded expectations. Only a day after the official start of coding, he released the "first alpha":/blog/2012/05/21/arquillian-extension-spring-1-0-0-Alpha1 of the "Arquillian Spring extension":/modules/spring-extension from prototypes he had created since submitting his proposal. By the end of the summer, he had published the "first beta release":/blog/2012/08/17/arquillian-extension-spring-1-0-0-Beta1 of the extension, which included transaction and client-side test support in addition to the features included in the proposal. He's already well on his way to adding "Guice support":https://community.jboss.org/thread/206473 as well.
    
    Ever since Jakub proposed his GSoC project, he has become an integral member of the Arquillian community. We're exceptionally proud of him and fortunate to have him as a contributor.
