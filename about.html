        <p>Since 4 years I am fascinated with both front-end and back-end technologies, magic and possibilities of HTML5 / CSS3 / Javascript.</p>
        <p>My journey starts with back-end technologies in PHP/Mysql and day by day I got fully command on Joomla, Wordpress and Mysql.</p>
        <p>In a project I got to learn jQuery and after seeing the power and magic of jQuery I got fascinated with front-end technologies and took my career a step ahead by working in JavaScript / jQuery and other front-end technologies.</p>
        <p>The scope of my work is a large part of the front end: jQuery plugins, animations, Paralax scrolling and other HTML / CSS / JS&nbsp;work .</p>
        <p>I also build the PHP / MySQL&nbsp;web applications on open source systems like WordPress and Joomla.</p>
